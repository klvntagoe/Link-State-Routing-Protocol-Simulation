To compile:
mvn compile assembly:single

To spawn respective routers:
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router1.conf
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router2.conf
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router3.conf
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router4.conf
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router5.conf
java -jar target/COMP535-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar conf/router6.conf

Cases Handled:
- Router initialization spawns a server
- Server can attach to multiple clients concurrently
- Attach process updates the link array
- Neigbors
- Start process spawns clients
- Start process updates link array from client POV
- Start process updates a link array from server POV

Edge Cases Handled:
- Router attaching to a server that it is already attached to (duplicating a directed edge)
- Router attaching to a server that is already its client (making a 2 node cycle)
- Start process with no new attachments
- Router attaching to a server with no free ports

Bugs:
- Client tries to attach to a server who has no free ports
    - Throws an IOException at first attempt
    - No action occurs after first attempt

Observations:
- SHOULD BE USING SEMAPHORES FOR CRITICAL SECTIONS
- Sockets instantiated by serverSocket.accept() are never closed
